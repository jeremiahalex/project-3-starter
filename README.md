## The Underserved Market

After purchasing home appliances and I.T. products, consumers often struggle to register for the warranty they rightfully deserve. More often than not, wholesale distributors and manufacturers of home appliances and I.T. products, regardless of size, woefully under-invest in customer support. This results in a painful warranty registration experience.

> [The Many Painful Experiences of Registering for Warranty](https://gist.github.com/limjiechao/5388ca1c669901f2e3eeda0590bfe758)

It often feels as though these manufacturers and distributors deliberately make it painful and frustrating so that many consumers would not even bother to register.

However, with more manufacturers and distributors bypassing traditional retailers with direct sales online, there is a growing impetus to *ensure a high level of satisfaction over the customer lifecyle as the key to maximize customer lifetime value*.

With this trend accelerating, we see an market opportunity where we can step in to serve.

### User Stories

As a customer,

* I want to register the product warranty easily and quickly.
* I want to be able to register for product warranty without being forced to first create an account.
* I want to head straight to the warranty registration form and not have to  google, search through the manufacturerâ€™s website or type in the URL.
* I should not have to type in product particulars such as model number, serial number, and warranty card number etc. which can be hard to locate, determine and distinguish.
* I should only have to furnish the particulars that only I can give.
* I should have exhaustive list of products I own that are still under warranty
* I should be able to raise a support ticket quickly from my list of products under warranty.
* I should be able to check the latest response from the manufacturer's response on my support ticket.

As the manufacturer/distributor,

* I want to provide my customers the best possible after-sales support without diverting scarce engineering resources and attention from the core business concerns.
* I should be able to tap into a fully developed after-sales support platform that my customer service officers can immediately use to provide customer support.
* My customer service officers should be able to see all the open support tickets and obtain the customers' emails to contact them.
* I should be able to track the outstanding warranties accurately.
* I should not have to spare engineering resources to maintain the customer support platform as it is not my core business competence.
