### User Stories

As a customer,
* I want to register the product warranty easily and quickly
* I want to be able to register for product warranty without being forced to first create an account
* I want to head straight to the warranty registration form and not have to  google, search through the manufacturerâ€™s website or type in the URL
* I should not have to type in product particulars such as model number, serial number, and warranty card number etc. which can be hard to locate, determine and distinguish
* I should only have to furnish the particulars that only I can give
* I should have exhaustive list of products I own that are still under warranty
* I should be able to raise a support ticket quickly from my list of products under warranty
* I should be able to check the latest response from the manufacturer's response on my support ticket

As the distributor/manufacturer,
* I want to provide my customers the best possible after-sales support without diverting scarce engineering resources and attention from the core business concerns.
